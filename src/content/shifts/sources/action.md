# Action shift

An Action shift changes the command between the policy and the simulator. The policy issues one
action and the task executes another; the result is always clipped to the action space.

## At a glance

| Aspect | Action shift |
|---|---|
| Perturbs | The action passed to `step`, before it reaches the simulator |
| Target in code | `action` |
| Modes | Stochastic, Adversarial, Parametric, Non-stationary, Composition |
| Spaces | Continuous action spaces; `rotate` needs two dimensions |
| Acts on a frozen policy | Yes |
| Backends | Any; `oppose_goal` needs a goal-conditioned maze task |

## Supported modes

| Mode | Mode name in code | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [Stochastic](../modes/stochastic.md) | `gauss` | Adds Gaussian noise to every action component |
| [Stochastic](../modes/stochastic.md) | `uniform` | Adds uniform noise to every action component |
| [Adversarial](../modes/adversarial.md) | `oppose` | Subtracts a fixed magnitude along the direction of the action |
| [Adversarial](../modes/adversarial.md) | `rotate` | Turns the action by an angle and keeps its magnitude |
| [Adversarial](../modes/adversarial.md) | `oppose_goal` | Removes the component of the action that points at the goal |
| [Adversarial](../modes/adversarial.md) | `adversarial` | Builds one of the three above, chosen by the parameter `kind` |
| [Parametric](../modes/parametric.md) | `shift` | Adds the same constant offset to every action component |
| [Non-stationary](../modes/non-stationary.md) | `schedule` on any of the seven mode names | Varies the noise level, the offset, the magnitude or the angle within the episode |
| [Composition](../modes/composition.md) | Several shifts in one list | The last shift in the list sees the action first |

## Parameters

| Mode name | Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| all | `clip_first` | bool | `False` | Clip the command to the action space before it is perturbed |
| `gauss` | `mu` | float | `0.0` | Mean of the noise |
| | `sigma` | float | `0.05` | Standard deviation of the noise |
| `uniform` | `low`, `high` | float | minus `range`, `range` | Bounds of the noise |
| | `range` | float | `0.1` | Shorthand for a symmetric interval |
| `shift` | `shift` | float | `value`, else `0.0` | The offset |
| `oppose` | `eps` | float | `0.2` | Magnitude that is subtracted |
| `rotate` | `degrees` | float | `60.0` | Angle the action is turned by |
| `oppose_goal` | `eps` | float | `1.0` | Share of the goal-directed component that is removed; 1 cancels it and 2 reverses it |
| `adversarial` | `kind` | str | `"oppose"` | `"oppose"`, `"rotate"` or `"oppose_goal"` |
| | the parameters of the member | | | As in the three rows above |

`clip_first` changes nothing for a policy that stays inside the action space. For a policy
whose output leaves the action space, it makes the shift reach the simulator instead of being
clipped away.

## Declare the shift

```python
from robustrllib import make_robust, ShiftSpec

STOCHASTIC = {
    "gauss":   ShiftSpec("action", "gauss", {"sigma": 0.10, "clip_first": True}),
    "uniform": ShiftSpec("action", "uniform", {"low": -0.10, "high": 0.10, "clip_first": True}),
}
PARAMETRIC = ShiftSpec("action", "shift", {"shift": 0.05, "clip_first": True})
```

Adversarial, on any continuous action space:

```python
ADVERSARIAL = {
    "oppose":      ShiftSpec("action", "oppose", {"eps": 0.10, "clip_first": True}),
    "adversarial": ShiftSpec("action", "adversarial", {"kind": "oppose", "eps": 0.10, "clip_first": True}),
}
```

Adversarial, on a goal-conditioned maze task with a two-dimensional action:

```python
ADVERSARIAL_MAZE = {
    "rotate":      ShiftSpec("action", "rotate", {"degrees": 60}),
    "oppose_goal": ShiftSpec("action", "oppose_goal", {"eps": 1.0}),
    "adversarial": ShiftSpec("action", "adversarial", {"kind": "rotate", "degrees": 60}),
}
env = make_robust("PointMaze_UMaze-v3", shifts=[ADVERSARIAL_MAZE["rotate"]], seed=0)
```

Non-stationary, with an opposition that grows within the episode:

```python
NON_STATIONARY = ShiftSpec(
    "action", "oppose", {"eps": 0.2, "clip_first": True},
    schedule={"type": "linear", "start": 0.0, "end": 1.0, "t0": 0, "t1": 500},
)
```

Composition with a Latency shift. The noise is added to the command, and the noisy command is
then delayed:

```python
COMPOSITION = [
    ShiftSpec("latency", "fixed", {"steps": 1}),
    ShiftSpec("action", "gauss", {"sigma": 0.10, "clip_first": True}),
]
```

A recording wrapper between the task and the shift shows the action that is executed.

```python
import numpy as np
import robustrllib.gym as gym
from robustrllib import build_pipeline


class Recorder(gym.Wrapper):
    def __init__(self, env):
        super().__init__(env)
        self.executed = None

    def step(self, action):
        self.executed = np.round(np.asarray(action), 3)
        return self.env.step(action)


def executed(spec, action, env_id="Hopper-v5"):
    recorder = Recorder(make_robust(env_id))
    env = build_pipeline(recorder, [spec], seed=0)
    env.reset(seed=0)
    env.step(np.asarray(action))
    env.close()
    return recorder.executed


print(executed(ShiftSpec("action", "oppose", {"eps": 0.2}), [0.5, 0.0, 0.0]))
print(executed(ShiftSpec("action", "oppose", {"eps": 0.2}), [0.1, 0.0, 0.0]))
print(executed(ShiftSpec("action", "rotate", {"degrees": 60}), [0.5, 0.0], "PointMaze_UMaze-v3"))
```

```text
[0.3 0.  0. ]
[-0.1  0.   0. ]
[0.25  0.433]
```

`oppose` takes the same magnitude from a large and from a small action, so the small action is
reversed. `rotate` keeps the magnitude of 0.5 and changes the direction.

## Rules

- `clip_first` is set on the Action shifts of an evaluation grid, so that the shift reaches the
  simulator for every policy.
- **`rotate` is defined for two-dimensional action spaces**; on `Hopper-v5` it raises
  `ValueError` at the first `step`.
- **`oppose_goal` is defined for goal-conditioned maze tasks**; on other tasks it raises
  `ValueError` at the first `step`.
- `adversarial` with `kind` and the member written as the mode name build the same shift.
- A value of `kind` other than the three members raises `ValueError` when the environment is
  built.
- The executed action never leaves the action space.
