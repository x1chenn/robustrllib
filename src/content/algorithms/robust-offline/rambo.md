## Mechanism

RAMBO augments the dataset with short rollouts from a learned dynamics ensemble and replaces
the uncertainty penalty by adversarial training of the model. The ensemble is updated to
lower the critic's value of the policy's transitions while a maximum-likelihood term keeps
it close to the data. The policy is behaviour-cloned before the first epoch.

RAMBO is a standalone recipe rather than a mechanism added to a shared base algorithm.

## Run the method

```bash
python baselines/rambo/train_rambo.py \
    -c robustrllib/configs/experiment/rambo_hopper.yaml --seed 0
```

| File | Path |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `baselines/rambo` |
| Algorithm card | `robustrllib/configs/algorithm/rambo.yaml` |
| Experiment file | `robustrllib/configs/experiment/rambo_hopper.yaml` |

Training is on the nominal task. The configuration files are explained in [Run a Method](../run-a-method.md), and the evaluation of the frozen checkpoint in [Evaluation Protocol](../../evaluation/protocol.md).

## Library-wide grid

Normalized score of the frozen last checkpoint. Q1 to Q4 are the severity quartiles of each perturbation ladder, ordered by displacement from the nominal setting, and *All* covers every shifted condition.

| Method | Nominal | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | All |

| **RAMBO** | **95.5** | **73.5** | **57.4** | **45.9** | **37.8** | **53.7** |

## By task
