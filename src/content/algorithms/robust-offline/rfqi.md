## Mechanism

RFQI replaces the fitted-Q target by a worst-case Bellman backup over a total-variation
uncertainty set of a fixed radius around the empirical transitions. The inner maximisation is
solved through a dual variable fitted per batch, and the actor and critic follow the
BCQ-style architecture of the original release.

RFQI is a standalone recipe rather than a mechanism added to a shared base algorithm.

## Run the method

```bash
python baselines/rfqi/train_rfqi.py \
    -c robustrllib/configs/experiment/rfqi_hopper.yaml --seed 0
```

| File | Path |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `baselines/rfqi` |
| Algorithm card | `robustrllib/configs/algorithm/rfqi.yaml` |
| Experiment file | `robustrllib/configs/experiment/rfqi_hopper.yaml` |

Training is on the nominal task. The configuration files are explained in [Run a Method](../run-a-method.md), and the evaluation of the frozen checkpoint in [Evaluation Protocol](../../evaluation/protocol.md).

## Library-wide grid

Normalized score of the frozen last checkpoint. Q1 to Q4 are the severity quartiles of each perturbation ladder, ordered by displacement from the nominal setting, and *All* covers every shifted condition.

| Method | Nominal | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | All |

| **RFQI** | **79.3** | **58.3** | **50.4** | **36.5** | **29.7** | **43.6** |
