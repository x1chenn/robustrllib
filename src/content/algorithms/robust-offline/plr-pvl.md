## Mechanism

PLR-PVL trains a collection of world models consistent with the offline data, treats each as
a level in the sense of unsupervised environment design, and prioritises them during policy
learning by the value loss they induce.

The library replaces the original world model with the flow-matching model of
[FWM](fwm.md). The ensemble consists of flow models that differ only in training seed,
each proposing one multi-step future for the same conditioning. The critic target is
taken per sample from the model whose rollout carries the largest positive value loss,
measured by the generalised-advantage residual of the current critic along that rollout.

**Implementation notes.**

- The selection rule is a learning-potential criterion, not a worst-case-return criterion: it picks the model the critic currently explains worst.
- The flow models are frozen during policy learning. No network is trained adversarially.

## Run the method

```bash
# 1. pretrain the flow-matching ensemble (seed 0 is shared with FWM)
python baselines/fwm_iql/pretrain_fm.py \
    --dataset mujoco/hopper/medium-v0 --fm-seeds 0 42 3047
# 2. train the policy
python baselines/run_baseline.py \
    -c robustrllib/configs/experiment/fmgan_iql_hopper.yaml \
    -- --seed 0
```

| File | Path |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `baselines/fmgan_iql` |
| Algorithm card | `robustrllib/configs/algorithm/fmgan_iql.yaml` |
| Experiment file | `robustrllib/configs/experiment/fmgan_iql_hopper.yaml` |

Training is on the nominal task. The configuration files are explained in [Run a Method](../run-a-method.md), and the evaluation of the frozen checkpoint in [Evaluation Protocol](../../evaluation/protocol.md).

## Library-wide grid

Normalized score of the frozen last checkpoint. Q1 to Q4 are the severity quartiles of each perturbation ladder, ordered by displacement from the nominal setting, and *All* covers every shifted condition.

| Method | Nominal | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | All |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| **PLR-PVL** | **102.7** | **76.9** | **60.2** | **45.4** | **37.3** | **55.0** |
| IQL (base algorithm) | 102.5 | 77.5 | 57.0 | 42.1 | 35.4 | 53.1 |

## By task
