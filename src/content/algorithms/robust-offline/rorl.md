## Mechanism

RORL makes an SAC learner conservative through smoothing. The critic and the policy are
regularised to vary little within a small ball around dataset states, and Q-values at
perturbed states are penalised by the disagreement of a ten-critic ensemble.

RORL is a standalone recipe rather than a mechanism added to a shared base algorithm.

## Run the method

```bash
python baselines/rorl/train_rorl.py \
    -c robustrllib/configs/experiment/rorl_hopper.yaml --seed 0
```

| File | Path |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `baselines/rorl` |
| Algorithm card | `robustrllib/configs/algorithm/rorl.yaml` |
| Experiment file | `robustrllib/configs/experiment/rorl_hopper.yaml` |

Training is on the nominal task. The configuration files are explained in [Run a Method](../run-a-method.md), and the evaluation of the frozen checkpoint in [Evaluation Protocol](../../evaluation/protocol.md).

## Library-wide grid

Normalized score of the frozen last checkpoint. Q1 to Q4 are the severity quartiles of each perturbation ladder, ordered by displacement from the nominal setting, and *All* covers every shifted condition.

| Method | Nominal | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | All |

| **RORL** | **79.3** | **60.3** | **48.7** | **40.8** | **31.4** | **45.3** |
