## Mechanism

RAMU applies a risk measure over sampled next-state perturbations to both the reward and the
cost targets. The original method is defined for TD learners; the library's row is a PPO
adaptation that applies the same transform to PPO's value targets.

## Run the method

The method is trained and evaluated with the Isaac Lab recipe, on the PPO implementation that every method of this group shares.
