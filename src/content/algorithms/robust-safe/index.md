# Robust Safe Algorithms

Robust safe methods add a cost constraint and make it hold under shifted dynamics. They are implemented in the online setting on a shared PPO learner and run on the Isaac Lab tasks.

## At a glance

|---|---|
| Interface | The Isaac Lab training and evaluation recipe |
| Shared learner | One PPO implementation for every method |
| Constraint | A cost budget on joint-limit violations |
| Tasks | Unitree G1 locomotion and Franka drawer manipulation |

*Claimed robustness* is the shift the original paper targets.

## Run a method

The methods of this group are trained and evaluated with the Isaac Lab recipe, on one PPO implementation that every method shares.
