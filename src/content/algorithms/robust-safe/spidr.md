## Mechanism

SPiDR trains a constrained policy under domain randomisation and adds a pessimistic cost
penalty proportional to the disagreement of next-state predictions across sampled dynamics.
It runs with the original solver and a joint-limit cost budget.

## Run the method

The method is trained and evaluated with the Isaac Lab recipe, on the PPO implementation that every method of this group shares.
